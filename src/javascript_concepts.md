# Javascript Concepts

Well, technically, Typescript in this book. The main reason why I use ts instead of js everywhere in this book is because I want to be extra clear about what types are passed around, what you'll get back from a function without having to run it, and the easiest way of accomplishing this that doesn't require you to run the code is by adding type annotations. So, Typescript it is!

I also recommend that if you haven't gotten into typescript yet you really should get started. I was against it for the longest time too, trust me, I know what you're feeling, but it really is better once you get used to it. In the beginning you fight the compiler a bit and clumsily add `any` all over the place to bypass warnings, but as you go along it starts to click and you'll really appreciate the types.
