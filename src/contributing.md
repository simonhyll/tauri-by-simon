# Contributing

Tauri is an open source project, and in fact you'd be shocked by how uncomplicated it is to actually contribute to it, and how little you need to get started. I'm a member of the Working Group, and I don't have any special magical access to some secret part of the project for contributing, I contribute to Tauri in just the same way you do, by opening Github, forking the project, creating a new branch, making changes, testing, making signed commits, creating a pull request for my changes, then waiting for someone to review and merge it. That's it, there really is no secret magic to contributing.

The real difficult part is wrapping your head around the project, understanding its various parts, and discussing things with the team before you develop them so you don't waste your time developing a feature that will never be accepted.
