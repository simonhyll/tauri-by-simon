# Testing

Any proper project requires a proper test suite!

## Test driven development (TDD)

If you have never done test driven development before, I urge you to try it. It takes a while to get into, but it will lead to much higher quality code in the end with much higher coverage by default (coverage is the amount of your codebase that is tested).
