# Security mindset

## Deliver tokens safely then bail

Do you have a super secret token that identifies the user? Are you wondering where you can store it securely? The answer is that you can store it unencrypted literally anywhere on the users computer and it's no longer your responsibility to ensure that token doesn't get stolen.

Of course, that doesn't mean you should develop your app to be completely careless, you can assist your users in staying secure, but the fact of the matter is that any information stored on a clients machine has to be assumed that it could be retrieved by either the user or their hacked computer. You are not responsible for ensuring the users computer doesn't get hacked. Granted of course, there are better and worse ways of handling a lot of things that may invite security threats, but when it comes to things like files saved on their system? Well, think about it. If the user is the only one that has access to their filesystem, why can't you let them look at their own token? They can't do anything bad using their own token (unless your servers are improperly developed). And if the user isn't the only one with access to their filesystem, if they've been hacked, then not only is one of their last concerns whether your apps token gets stolen, but there's absolutely nothing you can do about the hacker getting access to the token no matter where or how you store it. If it's accessible to your app it's accessible to the hacker, period.

For this reason focus on how to deliver the token safely, using encryption for the transport using HTTPS, making sure your API has its firewalls set up, things related to safely delivering and receiving the token. What happens on the users system isn't your responsibility, it's the users and their antiviruses responsibility to ensure they don't get hacked. Yes, some locations are better to store the token in than others. Yes, storing it in the sytems keyring is better than on their desktop. But in the end it doesn't make nearly as much a difference as how you made the token get from A to B. Once the token has been safely delivered to the users filesystem the hacker would require filesystem access to get it, which again at that point the user has a lot bigger issues than a rogue token.
