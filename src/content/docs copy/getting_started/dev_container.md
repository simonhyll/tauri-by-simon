# DevContainer

If you're using VSCode you may be aware of the feature it offers called "DevContainers". In its simplest form it's a Docker container you run on your computer that offers all the developer tools you need with the purpose of ensuring all developers on a project can both easily set up a complete dev environment as well as that they all work using the same versions.
