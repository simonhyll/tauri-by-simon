# create-tauri-app (CTA)

Basic intro about CTA and how to use it to get started quickly.

## Setting up without CTA

It's important to remember that Tauri is **frontend agnostic**. To assist people in getting started Tauri supplies some getting started pages, and CTA lets you set up various frameworks quick and easy, but this doesn't mean that those frameworks in any way shape or form are the only ones supported.

For any project you set up that is compatible with Tauri you can easily set up your project by simply running the `tauri init` command. In fact, I use it all the time since there's no official Nuxt template.

```bash!
# Initiate your project
npx nuxi init
cd nuxt-app
# Initiate src-tauri
tauri init
```
