# Tauri CLI

There may be more or fewer commands than what's listed below in the version you're on, but these are the ones that are currently there and that are the most important to be aware of.

Note that whenever we talk about Tauri commands being ran, e.g. `tauri dev` or `tauri info`, you'll need to add whatever method you're using to run the CLI. For example, if you used Cargo to install the Tauri CLI you would run `tauri info` using `cargo tauri info`. If you install it using NPM you would run `tauri info` as `npm run tauri info`. With PNPM you would run `tauri info` using `pnpm tauri info`.

## tauri dev

## tauri build

## tauri completions

## tauri android dev

## tauri ios dev

## tauri info

> Note: `@tauri-apps/cli` from the output is deceptively not only the NPM version, but also the Cargo version.

This command is really useful for debugging purposes.
