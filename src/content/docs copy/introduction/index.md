# Introduction

This is a book about Tauri.

It's very early work in progress!

It's highly opinionated.

Its categories aren't alphabetical but rather I've attempted to sort them based on when you're ready to know something. Read it from start to finish for the most complete experience, not jumping around as you see fit.

## About Simon

Hi! Simon here, some guy from Sweden with a passion for programming. Here's some form of summary of my time with Tauri:

- Joined the Discord server in 2021 when he wanted assistance in setting up an internal tool for the company he was working at
- Stuck around as he saw there were a lot of users in need of assistance and providing others with assistance on your break is a much better way of spending your time than playing Minesweeper
- Received the Helping Hand special role on the server as a form of reward for the hard work he'd put into helping others
- Wanted to contribute to Tauri as best he could and saw that the Discord bot needed some love and care, so that's where he started
- Joined the Working Group in 2022 after Lorenzo Lewis recommended it
- Provides his input on various topics related to the development of the project
- Started making contributions to the "real" projects with mainly bug fixes and documentation improvements
- Created a Youtube channel where he primarily talks about Tauri
- Writing this book in 2023

With the rise of JavaScript frameworks such as Vue.js, React, and Angular, the need for a simple and effective way to create desktop applications using these technologies has become apparent. Tauri, an innovative project in the field of web-based desktop application development, presents a unique solution to this issue. In this article, we'll take an introductory look at what Tauri is and the benefits it offers.

Tauri is an open-source toolkit for building highly secure, light, and fast desktop applications. Its core aim is to make application development more efficient by leveraging modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows developers to create applications using their preferred web tech stack, be it Vue.js, React, Svelte, or any other, and compile them into a small, single binary for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Unlike Electron, a popular but often criticized tool for building desktop applications with JavaScript due to its high memory usage and large application size, Tauri takes a different approach. Tauri applications boast a significantly smaller binary size, faster execution, and a security-first architecture.

Instead of bundling an entire Chromium instance with every app like Electron, Tauri apps interact with a lightweight webview provided by the operating system. This design decision contributes to the reduced resource usage, resulting in quicker startup times and less memory consumption. Developers can thus build sleek and performant desktop apps without sacrificing the familiarity and flexibility of their chosen web tech stack.

From a security standpoint, Tauri strengthens the traditional sandbox that Chromium provides. It uses a hardened Rust backend and leverages the security features of the webview, resulting in applications that are resilient against various types of attacks.

Moreover, Tauri also supports access to system APIs, like file system access, threading, and custom protocol handling, directly from the Rust backend, allowing developers to craft powerful applications with rich features.

To summarize, Tauri offers a new, efficient, and secure pathway for developers to convert web applications into desktop applications. By bringing together the best of web and native development, it encourages developers to build lighter, faster, and more secure apps, promising an exciting future for desktop application development. It's indeed an emerging technology worth exploring for any web developer looking to expand their horizons into the realm of desktop applications.
