<SimonSays title="Everyone needs help sometimes">
Don't hesitate to reach out when you need it!

## Discord

<SimonSays title="The community is here for you">
Either hit me up in the Tauri discord or preferably make a post in the #support channel.

## CrabNebula
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Support company">
If you can't share your source code when looking for support you'll need to get professional support since it comes with proper NDA agreements.

CrabNebula consists largely of members of the core Tauri developers. It doesn't get more professional than that.
