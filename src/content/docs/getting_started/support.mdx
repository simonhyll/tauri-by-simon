## Discord
<br/>
<SimonSays title="The main community hub">
Don't be afraid to @ me on the Tauri server, just remember I'm just some random weirdo online, I'm not paid support staff, my engagement with Tauri is completely unpaid, I just like helping people.

Do note that I am not bound by NDA and I don't appreciate being sent weird zip files. Keep it on the server and share code publicly, both for my sake and for the sake of the others that are struggling with the same issue as you.

Try using the search feature on Discord, you wouldn't believe how much of the Tauri knowledge base is being kept in Discord conversations!

## CrabNebula
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Support company">
If you can't share your source code when looking for support you'll need to get professional support since it comes with proper NDA agreements.

CrabNebula consists largely of core Tauri developers. It doesn't get more professional than that!

## StackOverflow
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Help spread the word">
Way too much of our knowledge base is in Discord conversations. If you have the time, make a StackOverflow post about your issue before posting it in #support and either link to it so we can answer there, or even just once your problem is solved you can fill in the solution yourself. It's perfectly valid in SO to answer your own questions, I've done it once or twice!
