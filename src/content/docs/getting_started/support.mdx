## Discord
<br/>
<SimonSays title="The main community hub">
Don't be afraid to @ me on the Tauri server, just remember I'm just some random weirdo online, I'm not paid support staff, my engagement with Tauri is completely unpaid, I just like helping people.

Do note that I am not bound by NDA and I don't appreciate being sent weird zip files. Keep it on the server and share code publicly, both for my sake and for the sake of the others that are struggling with the same issue as you.

Try using the search feature on Discord, you wouldn't believe how much of the Tauri knowledge base is being kept in Discord conversations!

## CrabNebula
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Support company">
If you can't share your source code when looking for support you'll need to get professional support since it comes with proper NDA agreements.

CrabNebula consists largely of core Tauri developers. It doesn't get more professional than that!

## StackOverflow
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Help spread the word">
Way too much of our knowledge base is in Discord conversations. If you have the time, make a StackOverflow post about your issue before posting it in #support and either link to it so we can answer there, or even just once your problem is solved you can fill in the solution yourself. It's perfectly valid in SO to answer your own questions, I've done it once or twice!

One of my more popular self answers: [How do you center text in Gitlab markdown?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53273660/how-do-you-center-text-in-gitlab-markdown)

## Artificial Intelligence
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Not all AI are made equal">
Be cautious when you decide to resort to prompting AI for answers regarding Tauri and Rust.
They don't have the full context of your application nor are they generally specialized in
programming and Tauri.

I would encourage anyone to get a ChatGPT 4 subscription, it might not be flawless yet but it's
an incredibly good tool to avoid bothering the people around you with stupid questions. A
judgment free zone for learning. Just make sure you sanity check it from time to time by checking
official references and resources or else it, like any AI, can lead you down a dark path of pain
and misery.

Some are certainly better than others, here's my tier list based on my experience with them.
</SimonSays>

- ChatGPT 4: Like talking to a university graduate. Has the best understanding and information that I've encountered thus far.
- Gemini Ultra: Supposedly good but based on my testing not as good as ChatGPT 4.
- ChatGPT 3.5: Kinda like talking to a high schooler. An overconfident junior developer.
- Phind: Never used it myself but based on the code people show me in the Discord it's not very good.
- Gemini: Literally told me it doesn't understand Rust.
