  No amount of book smarts will teach you how to develop Tauri. Pick a pet project and go nuts with it!

  If you find yourself struggling come back here and try to find an article that best solves your current issue. Efficient learning is largely about learning just enough to fix your current problem.

  If you're unsure what to do next you can read the questions below, I've gotten them a lot from beginners.

  Or if you're more of a book learner you can keep reading about [Concepts](/concepts).
