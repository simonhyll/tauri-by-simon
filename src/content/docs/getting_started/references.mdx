<SimonSays title="Where I find my information">
Pretty much everything you find me write about in here is a mix of experience and reading reference material elsewhere. You don't need my articles to figure out how to use Tauri, the information is already out there, it might just not have been compiled in a way that's easy for you to ingest.

Here are the primarily places I use when I need to find information on how something is done, and what I look at first to answer questions that I can't simply link people to my own articles for.

## tauri.app

The official website.

## docs.rs/tauri

The docs.rs generated documentation for the Tauri crate.

## github.com/tauri-apps/tauri

The actual source code.
