<SimonSays title="Welcome!">
I'm Simon and I'll be giving you the short TL;DR version of what you're reading. So if you find it hard to read the longer boring text you can go ahead and just skip ahead to the parts where you see me, and only read the longer text if something gets confusing.

The TL;DR of this page is that it's just some boring information about some weirdos goals for the website, you can safely skip ahead.
