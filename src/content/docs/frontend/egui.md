# Egui

This is currently the main alternative Tauri offers that lets you develop something truly native. Using this option you're not using a webview like most Tauri apps do, you're developing something that's pure Rust and pure native.

If you're not a very competent Rust and Tauri developer I wouldn't recommend this option, but I wanted to mention that it's there to illustrate that Tauri truly is frontend agnostic. It is developed from the ground up on the idea that you can use different runtimes with it and while Wry is the biggest option right now, it's not the only option.
