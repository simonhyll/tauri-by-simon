# Rust first

This is an approach I advocate for projects in general but even more so for Tauri projects.

Treat the webview as if it were completely incompetent. Put all your logic in the Rust end and only use the webview for input/output purposes.

This will not just produce a faster, safer, better project, but it'll help you get into the right mindset for how to develop with Tauri. The IPC for example is still quite limited in its performance, and so to avoid having to rely on it you should instead create your project in a manner where you simply don't need it.
