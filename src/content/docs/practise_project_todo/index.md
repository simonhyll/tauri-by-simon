# Practise project: Todo

In this project we'll be going through **ALL** the steps involved with developing a project start to finish, including all the stuff you don't want me to go over like project planning and project management.

I strongly recommend you go through it how I've done it, everything I use is free and you can decide to set up your own project differently later, take this as an exercise and an opportunity to discover new tools. We'll focus a lot on Github here, if you prefer Gitlab I still want you to use Github while following along in this project simply because it'll make it easier. This is an exercise, you're not expanding this project into a real project.
