<SimonSays title="Tauri is unopinionated about your project structure">
The folder that's by default called `src-tauri` is just a Rust crate. It doesn't have to be located anywhere in particular in your project. In fact, I always rename it to something like `backend` and put my frontend in a folder called `frontend`, keeping them separate.

So you can employ standard best practises for Rust project structuring. I recommend looking into using a Cargo workspace if you have multiple Rust based projects in the same repository.
