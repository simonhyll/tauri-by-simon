<SimonSays>
Tauri doesn't support being compiled to WASM (yet). What this means for you that wants to make your app available in a users browser is that you need to make your frontend capable of running completely separated from any Tauri functionality.

This project sample helps you with some of the structuring and philosophy regarding getting that to happen.
