title: Labs
description: Guided little experiments.
summary: |
  Labs are small self contained projects that take you through developing something fairly specific from start to finish, helping you explore the ecosystem and learn how to develop apps.

  The labs are divided into tracks. All labs in a track are self contained and can be taken without completing the labs before it thanks to the catchup mechanic of cloning a repository set up with the code from the labs before it.

## Features

This track teaches you the fundamental capabilities you have at your disposal when developing Tauri applications. The end result won't necessarily be a well thought through app that does something meaningful, but rather a jumbled mess of features for the sake of showing off what Tauri is capable of.

## ChatGPT

This track takes you through the complete development from start to finish for a ChatGPT application. Learn how to communicate with API's, develop an Axum server, handle login sessions, and how you can go about ensuring your Tauri apps frontend remains web capable.

## DevOps

This track builds on the finished result of the ChatGPT track and takes it further by exploring DevOps related topics. The exact system deployed isn't all that crucial, hence the decision to reuse the ChatGPT tracks resources.

## Project Management

In this track we'll look into topics regarding project management and project planning. In my experience most people who hate things like Agile meetings and project management in general are the ones that either don't understand them or the ones that have been working in teams that didn't understand it. I'll be focusing on project management in GitHub, but the skills are highly transferrable.
