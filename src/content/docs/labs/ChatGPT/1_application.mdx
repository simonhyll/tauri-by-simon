<Steps>
1. **Create a project**

    Tauri has a project called "Create Tauri App", or CTA for short.
    <ShowSolution>
    ```sh frame="none"
    # Spam click Enter to select all defaults
    pnpm create tauri-app --beta
    ```
    </ShowSolution>
2. **Run the project**

    Use the Tauri Command-Line Interface (CLI) to run the project.
    <ShowSolution>
    ```sh frame="none"
    pnpm install
    pnpm run dev
    ```
    </ShowSolution>
</Steps>
