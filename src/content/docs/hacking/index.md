# Hacking

Before anybody asks, no, these are not top secret vulnerabilities of Tauri, nor do I even attempt at exposing anything like that. These are more like showcases about very specific security related aspects that are applicable to any application you make and focus solely on things that are either known or are already readily available.

If you come here looking for how to exploit a Tauri app, then this isn't the place you're looking for.

For example, extracting the frontend isn't considered a security concern. Some users don't like it, but we've always built the security of Tauri based on the idea that a dedicated hacker can extract the frontend. Only exceptionally poorly developed applications would actually become vulnerable from having their frontend exposed.
