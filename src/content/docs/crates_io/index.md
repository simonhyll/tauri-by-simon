# Crates.io

This section is dedicated to [crates.io](crates.io). I'll go over some of the more noteworthy crates that you should be aware of exist, and maybe some that you shouldn't. The main purpose of this section is to expand your horizons by showing you that there is in fact a growing ecosystem of Rust crates at your disposal, you're not limited to just using the Tauri plugins, you can use any crates you find in your backend.
