<SimonSays title="I am not a legal expert and this is not legal advise">
These are legal topics you should get familiar with but keep in mind that I'm not a legal expert, laws may be different where you are and things might've changed since I wrote this.

You **have** to contact a legal expert to get proper legal advise.
