<SimonSays title="A unique ID for your app">
When you develop a Tauri app you're gonna need your app to be uniquely identifiable for the purposes of e.g. folder creation. You can't use the default `com.tauri.dev` ID because it would be used by many thousands of other apps. It should be in a reverse domain id format, but you don't need to actually own a domain in order to use it. If you do have a domain though it's better to use that, especially if you are developing for a company.
