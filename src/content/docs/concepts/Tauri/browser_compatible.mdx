<SimonSays title="Making your app run in a browser">
Tauri doesn't officially support running your app in a browser, not because there's no interest in making it happen, but because if you think about it, a browser compatible Tauri app is just your frontend project without the Tauri API.

So while Tauri isn't officially browser compatible it's actually fairly trivial to make your app be browser compatible, **if** you plan for it from the start.
