<SimonSays title="You don't need in-depth knowledge of all these">
These concept articles are meant to be more theoretical and free form, explaining topics primraily indirectly related to Tauri. You should definitely read through all the titles for all the articles so you've heard about them at some point, but you don't have to read the full articles if you don't want to.

You can also skip ahead past all the concepts if you want and just return here when you feel it's necessary. Effective learning is largely about just learning what you need right now.
