<SimonSays title="You don't need in-depth knowledge in all these">
These concept articles are meant to be more theoretical and free form, explaining topics primarily indirectly related to Tauri. You should definitely read through all the titles for all the articles on their respective Overview pages so you've heard about them at some point, but you don't have to read the full articles if you don't want to.

I'll be making reference links back to these concepts when you need them, so if you want you can just jump ahead to [Frontend](/frontend).
