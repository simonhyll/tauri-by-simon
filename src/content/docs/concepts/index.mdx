These concept articles are meant to be more theoretical and free form, explaining topics directly or indirectly related to Tauri. You should definitely read through all the titles for all the articles on their respective Overview pages so you've heard about them at some point, but you don't have to read the full articles if you don't want to. It's more of a knowledge dump than a structured set of articles.

I'll be making reference links back to these concepts when you need them, so if you want you can just jump ahead to [Frontend](/frontend).
