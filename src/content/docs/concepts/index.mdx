<SimonSays title="You don't need in-depth knowledge in all these">
These concept articles are meant to be more theoretical and free form, explaining topics primarily indirectly related to Tauri. You should definitely read through all the titles for all the articles so you've heard about them at some point, but you don't have to read the full articles if you don't want to.

You can also skip ahead past all the concepts if you want and just return here when you feel it's necessary. Effective learning is largely about just learning what you need right now.

I'll be making reference links back to these concepts when you need them.
