description: How to set up Rayon in a Tauri app and play nicely with Tokio.
summary: |
  Here we'll look into how to make best use of Rayon in a Tauri app. And before you ask, the
  reason you'd want to mix in Rayon when you already have Tokio in your Tauri app is because
  Tokio runs concurrently, Rayon runs in parallel. Which oversimplified means that if you
  run something big, heavy and blocking in Tokio you'll be preventing other work from
  progressing since tasks run in a cooperative manner, while in Rayon all threads are assholes
  that just care about themselves.

  Tokio for I/O bound tasks.

  Rayon for CPU bound tasks.

## Setup

```sh
cargo add rayon
```

You can also configure the threadpool for Rayon, though I wouldn't recommend it, you'll most likely make it better on your machine and worse for everyone else.

```rust
.setup(|app| {
  rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::default().build_global().unwrap();
})
```

## Iterators

Instead of using boring old synchronous iterators, lets make them parallel with Rayon. Just replace `.iter()` with `par_iter()` and presto, your synchronous task is now fully parallel.

```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn sum(inputs: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
  inputs.par_iter()
        .map(|&i| i * i)
        .sum()
}

fn main() {
  println!("{}", sum(vec![1,2,3,4,5]));
}
```

## ThreadPoolBuilder

If you don't want to make use of the global threadpool you can make a temporary local threadpool for use in a specific task.

```rust
let pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::default().build().unwrap();
let do_it = || {
    print!("one ");
    pool.install(||{});
    print!("two ");
};
rayon::join(|| do_it(), || do_it());
```
