description: How to perform common tasks with Tokio in a Tauri app.
summary: |
  Tauri offers a Tokio runtime by default. Here are some common things you'll need to know how
  to do in order to use Tokio effectively in Tauri.

## Setup

In most projects this part is unnecessary because you only need the capabilities from Tokio that Tauri re-exports in `tauri::async_runtime`. However, if you need more advanced functionalities from the broader Tokio ecosystem there's absolutely nothing wrong with adding it directly.

```sh
cargo add tokio
```

## Async Main Function

:::caution
Don't use `tokio::main` to create an `async fn main` for your Tauri app. The reason is very simple. You don't need it, Tauri already provides you with a Tokio Runtime, and all the macro does is generate a new main function for you that sets up a runtime before running the main function. Whatever you have that you think needs to run specifically in the main function I promise can run in the `.setup` function instead.
:::

```rust
async fn setup(app: AppHandle) {
  // Do your async setup here instead
}

fn main() {
  Builder()
  .setup(|app| {
    tauri::async_runtime::block_on(setup(app.handle()));
  })
}
```

## Background Threads

In order to spawn a background thread in Tauri all you have to do is use `tauri::async_runtime::spawn()`. This will schedule an async function to be executed by one of the Tokio runtimes worker threads.

:::caution
If your background thread isn't going to run cooperatively yielding somewhat frequently it might be better to use `std::thread::spawn` or Rayon for that task.
:::

```rust
async fn my_daemon() {
  loop {
    println!("I run in the background!");
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
  }
}

fn main() {
  Builder()
  .setup(|app| {
    tauri::async_runtime::spawn(my_daemon());
  })
}
```
