description: How to pop open a window for your TrayIcon.
summary: |
  The context menu for a tray icon can't be very fun, it's just a plain boring context menu. To remedy that we'll take the left click event and pop open a new window.

First set up your project based on [TrayIcon Overview](/backend/trayicon/).

Develop and register a window based on [Window Overview](/backend/window/).


```rust
// tray.rs

// UNTESTED BECAUSE I AM LAZY ATM :)
// More at the pseudo code stage atm

pub fn setup(app: AppHandle) {
  // Register a tray icon event handler
  tray.on_tray_icon_event(move |tray_icon, event| {
    // Get an app handle
    let handle = app.app_handle();
    match event.click_type {
      ClickType::Left => {
        // Get the tray window you've previously registered
        let tray_window = handle.get_webview_window("tray_window").unwrap();
        // If it's visible, hide it and exit
        if tray_window.is_visible() {
          tray_window.hide();
          return
        }
        // If it's hidden, show it and set its position
        tray_window.show();
        tray_window.set_focus();
        tray_window.set_position(LogicalPosition {x: event.x, y: event.y})
      },
      ClickType::Right => {},
      ClickType::Double => {},
    }
  });
  Ok(())
}
```
