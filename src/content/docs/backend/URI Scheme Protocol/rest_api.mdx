title: REST API
description: Using a custom URI scheme protocol in Tauri as a form of REST API.
summary: |
  In this article we'll be looking into how you can use a custom URI scheme protocol as a form of local REST API but that can only be accessed by the webview.

  As always with this feature keep in mind that the protocol is **only accessible within the webview windows of your app**.

## Register the schema

```rust
// Unix: myscheme://some/path
// Windows: https://myscheme.localhost/some/path
tauri::Builder::default()
  .register_uri_scheme_protocol("myscheme", |app, req| {
    // Handle the HTTP request, then construct a response.
    tauri::http::ResponseBuilder::new().body(Vec::new())
  });
```
