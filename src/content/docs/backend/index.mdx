description: Developing the backend portion of a Tauri project.
summary: |
  The backend portion of a Tauri project means the native Rust end of the project, with direct and uninhibited access to the full system resources.

  There are plenty of projects that can be made that don't require a single line of Rust code being written. If you intend to rely on JavaScript to develop your project you can pretty much skip this entire section and just focus on studying plugin references.
