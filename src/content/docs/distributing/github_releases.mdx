<SimonSays>
This is a great alternative for anyone that doesn't want to develop their own custom server implementation. It's free to use and does everything you need.

Simply set up <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action" target="_blank">tauri-action</a> and it will handle building and pushing releases for you.
</SimonSays>

## Tauri Configuration
<br/>
<SimonSays title="The endpoint must be publicly accessible">
Make sure you set up your endpoints so that your users can access them. There are advanced techniques available for not making endpoints completely public, but if you gotta ask how to do it you're not ready for it.
</SimonSays>

```json
// tauri.conf.json
{
  "tauri": {
    "updater": {
      "active": true,
      "endpoints": [
        "https://github.com/USERNAME/PUBLIC_REPOSITORY/releases/latest/download/latest.json"
      ],
      "dialog": true,
      "pubkey": "YOUR_UPDATER_SIGNATURE_PUBKEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Sample Release Workflow
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Drafts don't show up on your front page.">
If you don't see your release on GitHub make sure to visit the releases page manually to verify if the issue is simply that you're still dealing with a draft release.

            Mac: Extract the .app from the .dmg and run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine your-app.app`.
            Windows: Run `attrib -r your-app.msi:Zone.Identifier`.

## Private Repository
<br/>
<SimonSays title="The easiest solution is making a second public repository">
While it's possible to have a super weird direct GitHub API variant for it the by far easiest solution for private repositories is to just make a separate public repository.

In your GitHub workflow simply ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has access to the public repository, e.g. by using a personal access token, and set the target repository for `tauri-action` manually in its `owner` and `repo` options.
</SimonSays>

```yaml
      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: false
          prerelease: false
          includeUpdaterJson: true
          owner: ORGANIZATION
          repo: PUBLIC_REPOSITORY
```

## Troubleshoot

### Error: Resource not accessible by integration

It's still unknown why this happens, but there seems to be something weird going on in GitHubs end. I managed to get past this by running the workflow once using a personal access token with every single permission granted you can imagine. After that something gets unblocked that allows you to revert to a more sane workflow. Again, no idea why it happens, but at least it's a temporary issue, run with an admin PAT once and you should be unblocked.

Simply create a PAT for your user, give it all permissions, then instead of `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` you set it to your PAT, e.g. `GH_PAT`. Remember to add the secret to your repository before running the workflow.
