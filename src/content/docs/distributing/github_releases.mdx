<SimonSays>
This is a great alternative for anyone that doesn't want to develop their own custom server implementation. It's free to use and does everything you need.

Simply set up <a href="https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action" target="_blank">tauri-action</a> and it will handle building and pushing releases for you.
</SimonSays>

## Tauri Configuration
<br/>
<SimonSays title="The endpoint must be publicly accessible">
Make sure you set up your endpoints so that your users can access them. There are advanced techniques available for not making endpoints completely public, but if you gotta ask how to do it you're not ready for it.
</SimonSays>

```json
// tauri.conf.json
{
  "tauri": {
    "updater": {
      "active": true,
      "endpoints": [
        "https://github.com/USERNAME/PUBLIC_REPOSITORY/releases/latest/download/latest.json"
      ],
      "dialog": true,
      "pubkey": "YOUR_UPDATER_SIGNATURE_PUBKEY_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

## Sample Release Workflow
<br/>
<SimonSays title="Drafts don't show up on your front page.">
If you don't see your release on GitHub make sure to visit the releases page manually to verify if the issue is simply that you're still dealing with a draft release.

# .github/workflows/distribute.yaml

# `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Version 0.1.0"

        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
```

## Private Repository
<br/>
<SimonSays title="The easiest solution is making a second public repository">
While it's possible to have a super weird direct GitHub API variant for it the by far easiest solution for private repositories is to just make a separate public repository.

In your GitHub workflow simply ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has access to the public repository, e.g. by using a personal access token, and set the target repository for `tauri-action` manually in its `owner` and `repo` options.
</SimonSays>

```yaml
      - uses: tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
          owner: ORGANIZATION
          repo: PUBLIC_REPOSITORY
```
