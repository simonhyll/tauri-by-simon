## Mac

- Use the native menu buttons. I prefer using the `Overlay` titlebar style so I can make a custom looking titlebar that has the native buttons on top of it. At the time of writing there sadly isn't an option for changing the padding of the buttons so it might look a bit awkward, but it's better than nothing.
