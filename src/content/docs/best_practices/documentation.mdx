Your project is not going to survive unless it's properly documented.

<SimonSays title="Answer questions with documentation. If none exists, write it, then answer with it">
This is an approach I've adopted when writing these articles. I sit on Discord waiting for questions to pop up and if the answer the person is looking for can't be found in one of my articles I update or create an article then send them to it.

This of course means that more often than not you're just a glorified search engine, but it helps people help themselves and drastically improves the projects likelihood if surviving the test of time.
