The difference between a "best practise" and a "concept" is that a best practise is backed by fact but is ultimately an opinion, while a concept is a presentation of facts. That at least is the distinction I'm going to be using.

So take everything you read here with a grain of salt, while I might link out to concepts to argue my case the best practise itself is really mostly just a matter of opinion. Opinions backed by facts, but opinons nonetheless.
