<SimonSays title="Pretend your app was a Rust CLI application plus a webview for input/output operations">
By developing your project as if it were a Rust CLI application, in other words whenever you want to make your frontend do anything you try to figure out how you can make the backend do it instead, you'll be ensuring your app is by default highly cross-platform, performant and really awesome.
