## Step 1: Set up the Android SDK

### Option 1: Android Studio

I know what you're thinking, "why the heck do I need to install an IDE to build for Android??" And while I might point you to both Mac and iOS that both depend on Xcode, the real reason option 1 and the recommended approach is getting Android Studio is because it's a more standardised approach and debugging your Android project regardless of what other IDE you're using is simply going to be easier using the dedicated IDE straight from Google.

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Add the following to `~/.zshrc`: 
```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export NDK_HOME="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/25.0.8775105"
```
3. Add the Android targets using rustup:
```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

### Option 2: Standalone SDK

## Step 2: Get a device

### Option 1: Create a virtual device

WIP

```bash
adb devices
```

### Option 2: Use a physical device

WIP

```bash
adb devices
```

## Hello World!

```bash
# Create a basic app by spamming enter
pnpm create tauri-app --beta
# Install dependencies
cd tauri-app
pnpm install
# Initialize the Android project
pnpm tauri android init
# Run the app
pnpm tauri android dev
```
