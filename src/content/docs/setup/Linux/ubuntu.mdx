description: Setting up Ubuntu for Tauri development.
summary: |
  In this article we'll take a look at the sort of setting up you need to do for
  basic desktop targeted development with Tauri.

## System dependencies

Tauri relies a lot on system dependencies, it's largely why the bundle size can be kept so small in comparison to some other frameworks *cough cough Electron cough*.

Your end users will require some of these to use your app but don't worry, the installers Tauri creates take care of ensuring your user has them installed.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  build-essential \
  curl \
  wget \
  file \
  libssl-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev
```

## Rust

Simply run this command and it will install `rustup`. Follow the prompts and remember to restart your terminal once it's done.

```bash
# Do you trust me? Just run this magic command!
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

```bash
# Don't trust me? Come on I thought we were pals!
# Download the script
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf > rustup.sh
# Read the script
less ./rustup.sh
# Satisfied? Good, now run it!
cat ./rustup.sh | sh
```

### Changing between stable and nightly

```bash
# Change to stable
rustup default stable
# Change to nightly
rustup default nightly
```

### Optional: Auto update Rust

I tend to set up a simple cronjob to keep Rust up to date. While a project might have a minimum supported version for whatever reason there's not really any good reason for you to not be using the very latest version available.

Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to figure out cronjob scheduling.

```bash
sudo crontab -e
# For stable, once a week is enough
0 0 * * 0 rustup update
# For nightly, once per, well, night, is plenty
0 0 * * * rustup update
```

## Hello World!

To verify that your system is set up correctly you should run a basic bootstrapped project.

This by the way is the way I tend to help people with their issues, running these commands
to set up a fresh new project, try compiling it to verify Tauri isn't fundamentally broken,
then add whatever code is needed to test your code. So if you ever have to make a reproduction
of a problem this is the basic setup you should do as well.

I'll be using `pnpm` here but you can adapt this to whatever method you want (that Tauri supports).

```bash
# Run create-tauri-app
# Just spam enter to get all defaults
pnpm create tauri-app --beta
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# Run the app
pnpm tauri dev
```
