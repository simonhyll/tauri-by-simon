# Practise project: Flashcards

For this project we're going to pretend we have an employer that wants us to develop an application for showing flashcards as a learning tool. They don't care much about the exact design, but they know enough about the job market to know what technologies they're looking for. It's not up to use to argue with their choices, we're just delivering a product.

## Requirements

- **React**: They explicitly want us to develop this project using React because it'll be easy for them to get developers who use it.
- **Postgres**: They want to use a database solution for storing the flashcards. Postgres scales well and doesn't require a commercial license to use.
- **C# server**: They want us to develop a C# based backend. This is a choice purely based on the job market saying C# developers are easy to get.
- **Python card creator**: Their researchers are more comfortable in Python than any other language, and they should have an easy way of creating new cards using e.g. Jupyter.
