# windows

This is the official Windows crate from Microsoft.

If you need to do something on Windows, this is the crate for you!

Note however that there's not a lot of documentation on specifically the Rust version, the entire crate is generated from their C++ code and in fact they point you to their C++ documentation to better understand it. It's very weird and advanced, but it's there if you need it.
