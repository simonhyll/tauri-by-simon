# Frontend agnostic

Tauri is a frontend agnostic framework. Within web development this has actually been a thing for a long time, though it goes under a different name: static hosting. Tauri takes this a bit further but the principle is the same, you develop something once, and multiple backends are capable of consuming it.

When you develop a frontend for Tauri you can think of it as if you were developing a website meant to be deployed on an Apache or Nginx server.
