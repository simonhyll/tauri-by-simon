# Rust Concepts

This won't be like a complete course on Rust, but rather some of the Rust concepts you need as a Tauri developer as well as some things that people tend to get confused about when they're learning Rust that I hope I can maybe explain a bit clearer than some other sources. But again, not a complete course on Rust.

> If you aren't going to write your own Rust code you can skip this part, but know I judge you for not wanting to learn Rust. Grr.
